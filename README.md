# My Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles using [YADM](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) in `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`.

## Requirements

 - yadm

> __Important__: For MacOs we need `brew`

## Usage

```bash
# adding the flag -f will overwrite our current dotfiles
yadm clone git@github.com:roag92/mydotfiles.git

# only if you want to execute the bootstrap script
~/.config/yadm/bootstrap
```
